    "Environmental changes that accompany the day becoming so\n",
    "predictable, nature devised an ingenious system: the circadian clock, to anticipate them and\n",
    "regulate physiology and behavior accordingly in organisms. These clocks generate cellular\n",
    "rhythms known as the circadian rhythms which is responsible for hormone release, digestion,\n",
    "body temperature, and other physical activities such as sleep-wake, feeding to specific times of\n",
    "the day. The cellular regulatory network of circadian clocks involves several genes and proteins,\n",
    "and relies on multiple interactions, transcriptional as well as posttranslational. This feedback\n",
    "loop is thought to drive complex physiological rhythms such as daily oscillations in blood\n",
    "pressure and metabolism through rhythmic transcription of output genes downstream of the core\n",
    "circadian clock.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have been able to develop a mathematical model  to study the circadian clock gene network. Identifying and assembling relevant information, key interactions and connections between the clock gene network was achieved from literature [Cox and Takahashi, 2019, Ko and Takahashi, 2006]. Five protein codding known clock genes were used in developing this model. For simplicity, we do not distinguished between the mutations in theses genes. Example Per1, Per2 and Per3 are represented by a single Per gene. The same principle applies to\n",
    "the proteins and respective protein complexes,. The gene network used in developing this model are Per, Cry, Ror, Rev-erb and Bmal1. This model emphasis on the grouping of the gene network into  Activators and Repressors. The Per, Cry, and  Rev-erb genes as the repressors and the Ror, and Bmal1 genes as the activators. The interactions and connections between these gene network was then transformed to a wiring diagram that consist of  two main dependent feedback loops: Per-Cry negative feedback loop and the Ror, Rev-erb, Bmal1 loop.\n",

    "The circadian core clock network was translated into a system of 23 ordinary differential equations(ODEs) with\n",
    "90 parameters. Law of mass action and linear degradation kinetics were mostly used in deriving the system\n",
    "of ordinary differential equations(ODEs) in order to avoid the complexity of our model [Gaffney et al., 2008].\n",
    "Several models mostly incorporate the usage of Michealis-Menten degradation kinetics allowing smaller Hill\n",
    "coefficients. The Michealis-Menten degradation kinetics consider more parameters and does increase the complexity of the model [Leloup and Goldbeter, 2003]. Nonlinearities were introduced in our model to describe the\n",
    "transcription reaction of all the genes by the use of Michealis-Menten and Hill coefficient [Chou, 1976].\n",

    "In this project I plan to examine the properties and dynamics of some key parameter values of the model. 20 parameter values comprising of the transcription rate, mRNA’s degradation rate, translation rates, the post-translation rates : such as protein–protein interaction, subnuclear localization, (the association and dissociation of\n",
